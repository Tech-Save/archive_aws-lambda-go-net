[AWS Lambda][aws-lambda-home] lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
[AWS API Gateway][aws-gtw-home] is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, 
maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. 

This project provides an AWS Lambda [network interface for Go][go-net-listener]. You can leverage AWS Lambda and 
AWS API Gateway to handle web requests using *any* Go application framework.

## Preview

> Below are some examples with popular Go frameworks. These examples are not exhaustive.
  **You are free to use anything you want!**

```sh
go get -u -d github.com/eawsy/aws-lambda-go-net/...
```

### Using [Go][go-http-pkg]

```go
package main

import (
  "net/http"

  "github.com/eawsy/aws-lambda-go-net/service/lambda/runtime/net"
)

func handle(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  w.Write([]byte("Hello, World!"))
}

func init() {
  go http.Serve(net.Listener(), http.HandlerFunc(handle))
}

func main() {}
```

### Using [Gin][gin-github]

```sh
go get gopkg.in/gin-gonic/gin.v1
```
```go
package main

import (
  "net/http"

  "github.com/eawsy/aws-lambda-go-net/service/lambda/runtime/net"

  "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func handle(ctx *gin.Context) {
  ctx.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello, %s!", ctx.Param("name"))
}

func init() {
  r := gin.Default()
  r.GET("/hello/:name", handle)
  go http.Serve(net.Listener(), r)
}

func main() {}
```

### Using [Gorilla][gorilla-github]

```sh
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
```
```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "net/http"

  "github.com/eawsy/aws-lambda-go-net/service/lambda/runtime/net"

  "github.com/gorilla/mux"
)

func handle(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s!", mux.Vars(r)["name"])))
}

func init() {
  r := mux.NewRouter()
  r.HandleFunc("/hello/{name}", handle)
  go http.Serve(net.Listener(), r)
}

func main() {}
```
